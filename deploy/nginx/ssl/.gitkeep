# This directory contains SSL certificates
# Do NOT commit actual certificates to version control

# Required files:
# - fullchain.pem: SSL certificate chain
# - privkey.pem: Private key

# For development, generate self-signed certs using the script:
# ./generate-dev-certs.sh

# For production, use certificates from:
# - Let's Encrypt (certbot)
# - Your organization's CA
# - Commercial certificate providers
